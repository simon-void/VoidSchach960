optimizations:
1)CheckStatus should contain a List<BoundLines>{Attacker, BoundFigure, King} stating explicitly which figures are bound!
2)is isNotBound easier to compute than !isBound?? (migth be unimportant after 1) )

features:
- resizable interface (inclusive full-screen)
- pure chess engine module with 2-way channels (so different engines (written e.g. in Go, Rust, ...) can be used)
